    <h4 style="color: brown;">Six - Years Integrated Course</h4>
   <p> The program offered by the RGUKT consists of a six year integrated course after 10th class examination leading to a B.Tech. degree. The first part of the six-year course is a two-year Pre University Course (equivalent to (AP) Intermediate) followed by a second part of four-year Engineering Course. At present the pre-university part of education offers premature specialization in tracks such as Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Life sciences (equivalent to MPC + BiPC). By bringing students in to the University at an earlier stage we hope to impart a broad based education including humanities and liberal arts to students.</p>
